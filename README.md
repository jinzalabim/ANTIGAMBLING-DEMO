# OSDCYOC-DEMO

> A demo for our final project in my class in Cyberspace, Organizations and Communities. This repository is intended to be for **demo purposes** only.

## **What is this repository about?**

Online casino advertisements have become prolific whether it be on social media or on TV networks. In the Philippines, this situation is made even worse when famous actors, influencers, vloggers and the likes, endorse online gambling. When people like Ivana Alawi or Alden Richards endorse online gambling — it’s as if it validates the existence and negates the risk of online casinos. Online casinos are everywhere, and they require little to no set-up or registration to be able to play, and the same goes into creating them. 

Inspired by these online casino websites, this demo will be a website with information regarding our topic. However, the catch is that the site will have a front of a typical online casino website where a user can only play a fixed amount of times before it redirects them to the next webpage where information on the risks of gambling and online casinos.
