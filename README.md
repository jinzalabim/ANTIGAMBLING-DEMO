# OSDCYOC-DEMO
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is one part of my demo for our final project in my class in Cyberspace, Organizations and Communities. This repository is intended to be for **demo purposes** only.

## **What is this repository about?**

Inspired by these online casino websites, this demo will be a website with information regarding online gambling. However, the catch is that the site will have a front of a typical online casino website where a user can only play a fixed amount of times before it redirects them to the next webpage where information on the risks of gambling and online casinos.

> [!NOTE]
> The i-frame demo of the gambling website is [here](https://www.pragmaticplay.com/en/games/#). 


> [!NOTE]
> The games in this site are iframes from [PragmaticPlay](https://www.pragmaticplay.com/en/games/#).
