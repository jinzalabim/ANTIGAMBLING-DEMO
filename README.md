## **OVERVIEW**

Online casino advertisements have become prolific whether it be on social media or on TV networks. In the Philippines, this situation is made even worse when famous actors, influencers, vloggers and the likes, endorse online gambling. When people like Ivana Alawi or Alden Richards endorse online gambling — it’s as if it validates the existence and negates the risk of online casinos. Online casinos are everywhere, and they require little to no set-up or registration to be able to play, and the same goes into creating them. This ease of access contributes to their growing popularity and associated problems.  

Inspired by these online casino websites,  **this demo project** addresses this issue by creating a website that mimics the appearance of an online casino. However, after a user engages with the games a set number of times, they are redirected to an informational page highlighting the risks of gambling and the ethical concerns surrounding online gambling.

## **Features**  

- **Online Casino Simulation**: The homepage mimics a typical online casino, complete with interactive game iframes.  
- **Educational Component**: After a fixed amount of user activity, the site redirects to an **informational page** providing resources and information on gambling risks.  
- **Simple Deployment**: The project uses Vercel for hosting and integrates iframes from **[PragmaticPlay](https://www.pragmaticplay.com/en/games/#)** for demonstration purposes.  
- **Awareness Campaign**: The site serves as a tool to highlight how online casinos operate and educate users on responsible gambling.

## **How It Works**  

1. **Interactive Games**: Users can engage with casino-style games embedded via PragmaticPlay's iframe system.  
2. **Time-Limited Interaction**: A timer limits the amount of time users can engage with the games. Once the limit is reached, they are redirected.  
3. **Informational Redirection**: Users are redirected to a page containing detailed information on gambling addiction, online casino risks, and resources for help.

## **Technical Details**  

- **Framework**: The website is built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- **Games**: Games are integrated via PragmaticPlay iframes.  
- **Hosting**: The project is deployed on **Vercel** for ease of access and sharing.  
- **Styling**: The CSS foundation is adapted from work by Jan Egil and Borge Refsnes, with customizations for the project's needs.
